# üñºÔ∏è  Art Connect ‚Äî A New Approach to Data for Art Institutes

*Contributors:* Oviya Adhan, Jordan Andersen, Tiffany Liu, Helin Yilmaz

*Premise:* The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) serves as a cultural hub for both in-person and online audiences. In this project, we explore the 470,000 artworks in the Met‚Äôs collection using NoSQL ‚Äî graph, document, and in-memory key-value ‚Äî databases to create a proof of concept (POC) on how the Met can augment their research, education, and visitor-engagement efforts.

*Methodology:* We set up a Neo4j graph database to prove out the solution to a defined set of use cases through PageRank, Closeness Centrality, and Louvain Modularity graph algorithms. For MongoDB document and Redis key-value databases, we explored how we‚Äôd further address these use cases without diving into a full proof concept as done with graph databases. The steps included:
* Define Use Cases
* Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing
* Neo4j POC Exploration:
** Graph Neo4j Database Set Up
** Graph Algorithms
* MongoDB, Redis Exploration

*Tools:* SQL, NoSQL Databases (Neo4j, MongoDB, Redis), Python
